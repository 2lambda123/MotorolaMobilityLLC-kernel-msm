config QPNP_REVID
	tristate "QPNP Revision ID Peripheral"
	depends on SPMI
	help
	  Say 'y' here to include support for the Qualcomm QPNP REVID
	  peripheral. REVID prints out the PMIC type and revision numbers
	  in the kernel log along with the PMIC option status. The PMIC
	  type is mapped to a Qualcomm chip part number and logged as well.

config QPNP_COINCELL
	tristate "Qualcomm QPNP coincell charger support"
	depends on SPMI
	help
	  This driver supports the QPNP coincell peripheral found inside of
	  Qualcomm QPNP PMIC devices.  The coincell charger provides a means to
	  charge a coincell battery or backup capacitor which is used to
	  maintain PMIC register state when the main battery is removed from the
	  mobile device.

config SPS
	bool "SPS support"
	select GENERIC_ALLOCATOR
	help
	  The SPS (Smart Peripheral Switch) is a DMA engine.
	  It can move data in the following modes:
		1. Peripheral-to-Peripheral.
		2. Peripheral-to-Memory.
		3. Memory-to-Memory.

config SPS_SUPPORT_BAMDMA
	bool "SPS support BAM DMA"
	depends on SPS
	default n
	help
	  The BAM-DMA is used for Memory-to-Memory transfers.
	  The main use cases is RPC between processors.
	  The BAM-DMA hardware has 2 registers sets:
		1. A BAM HW like all the peripherals.
		2. A DMA channel configuration (i.e. channel priority).

config SPS_SUPPORT_NDP_BAM
	bool "SPS support NDP BAM"
	depends on SPS
	default n
	help
	  No-Data-Path BAM is used to improve BAM performance.

config EP_PCIE
	bool "PCIe Endpoint mode support"
	select GENERIC_ALLOCATOR
	help
	  PCIe controller is in endpoint mode.
	  It supports the APIs to clients as a service layer, and allows
	  clients to enable/disable PCIe link, configure the address
	  mapping for the access to host memory, trigger wake interrupt
	  on host side to wake up host, and trigger MSI to host side.

config EP_PCIE_HW
	bool "PCIe Endpoint HW driver"
	depends on EP_PCIE
	help
	  PCIe endpoint HW specific implementation.
	  It supports:
		1. link training with Root Complex.
		2. Address mapping.
		3. Sideband signaling.
		4. Power management.

config GPIO_USB_DETECT
	tristate "GPIO-based USB VBUS Detection"
	depends on POWER_SUPPLY
	help
	  This driver supports external USB VBUS detection circuitry whose
	  output is connected to a GPIO. The driver in turn notifies the
	  USB driver of VBUS presence/disconnection using the power_supply
	  framework.

config MSM_11AD
	tristate "Platform driver for 11ad chip"
	depends on PCI
	depends on PCI_MSM
	default n
	---help---
	  This module adds required platform support for wireless adapter based on
	  Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. 11ad chip, integrated into MSM platform

	  If you choose to build it as a module, it will be called
	  msm_11ad_proxy.

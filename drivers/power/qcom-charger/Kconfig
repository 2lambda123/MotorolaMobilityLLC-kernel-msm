config QPNP_SMBCHARGER
	tristate "QPNP SMB Charger driver"
	depends on SPMI
	select POWER_SUPPLY
	help
	  Say Y here to enable the dual path switch mode battery charger which
	  supports USB detection and battery charging up to 3A.
	  The driver also offers relevant information to userspace via the
	  power supply framework.

config QPNP_FG
	tristate "QPNP fuel gauge driver"
	depends on SPMI
	select POWER_SUPPLY
	help
	  Say Y here to enable the Fuel Gauge driver. This adds support for
	  battery fuel gauging and state of charge of battery connected to the
	  fuel gauge. The state of charge is reported through a BMS power
	  supply property and also sends uevents when the capacity is updated.

config SMB135X_CHARGER
	tristate "SMB135X Battery Charger"
	depends on I2C
	select POWER_SUPPLY
	help
	  Say Y to include support for SMB135X Battery Charger.
	  SMB135X is a dual path switching mode charger capable of charging
	  the battery with 3Amps of current.
	  The driver supports charger enable/disable.
	  The driver reports the charger status via the power supply framework.
	  A charger status change triggers an IRQ via the device STAT pin.

config SMB1351_USB_CHARGER
	tristate "smb1351 usb charger (with VBUS detection)"
	depends on I2C
	select POWER_SUPPLY
	help
	 Say Y to enable support for the SMB1351 switching mode based charger.
	 The driver supports charging control (enable/disable) and
	 charge-current limiting. It also provides USB VBUS detection and
	 notification support. The driver controls SMB1351 via I2C and
	 supports device-tree interface.

config MSM_BCL_CTL
	bool "BCL Framework driver"
	help
	  Say Y here to enable this BCL Framework driver. This driver provides
	  interface, which can be used by the BCL h/w drivers to implement the
	  basic functionalities. This framework abstracts the underlying
	  hardware for the top level modules.

config MSM_BCL_PERIPHERAL_CTL
	bool "BCL driver to control the PMIC BCL peripheral"
	depends on SPMI
	depends on MSM_BCL_CTL
	select POWER_SUPPLY
	help
	  Say Y here to enable this BCL PMIC peripheral driver. This driver
	  provides routines to configure and monitor the BCL
	  PMIC peripheral.

config QPNP_SMB2
	tristate "SMB2 Battery Charger"
	depends on MFD_SPMI_PMIC
	select POWER_SUPPLY
	help
	  Enables support for the SMB2 charging peripheral

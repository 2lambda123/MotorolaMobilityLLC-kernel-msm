* st_lsm6dsr driver for imu MEMS sensors

Required properties for all bus drivers:
- compatible: must be one of:
              "st,lsm6dsr"

Required properties for the i2c bindings:
- reg: i2c slave address

Required properties for the spi bindings:
- reg:               the chipselect index
- spi-max-frequency: maximal bus speed, should be set to 1000000 unless
                     constrained by external circuitry

Optional properties for all bus drivers:
- st,int-pin:       the pin on the package that will be used to signal
                    "data ready" (valid values: 1 or 2, default: 1).

- drive-open-drain: the interrupt/data ready line will be configured as open drain,
                    which is useful if several sensors share the same interrupt line.

- interrupts:       interrupt mapping for IRQ. It should be configured with
                    flags IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH, IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING,
                    IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW or IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING.

                    Refer to interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt for generic interrupt
                    client node bindings.

Example for an spi device node:

lsm6dsox-imu@0 {
	compatible = "st,lsm6dsox";
	reg = <0x0>;
	spi-max-frequency = <1000000>;
	interrupt-parent = <&gpio0>;
	interrupts = <0 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	st,int-pin = <1>;
};

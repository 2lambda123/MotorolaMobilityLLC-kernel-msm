Qualcomm Technologies Inc. PNP v2 Flash LED

QPNP (Qualcomm Technologies Inc. Plug N Play) Flash LED (Light
Emitting Diode) driver v2 is used to provide illumination to
camera sensor when background light is dim to capture good
picture. It can also be used for flashlight/torch application.
It is part of PMIC on Qualcomm Technologies Inc. reference platforms.

Main node:

Required properties:
- compatible		: Should be "qcom,qpnp-flash-led-v2"
- reg			: Base address and size for flash LED modules

Optional properties:
- qcom,hdrm-auto-mode	: Boolean type to select headroom auto mode enabled or not
- qcom,isc-delay	: Integer type to specify short circuit delay. Valid values are 32, 64,
			  128, 192. Unit is us.
- qcom,hw-strobe-option	: Integer type to specify hardware strobe option. Based on the specified
			  value, additional GPIO configuration may be required to provide strobing
			  support. Supported values are:
			  0: Flash strobe is used for LED1, LED2, LED3
			  1: Flash strobe is used for LED1, LED2 and GPIO10 is used for LED3
			  2: Flash strobe is used for LED1; GPIO9 is used for LED2; GPIO10 is used for LED3

Child node: Contains settings for each individual LED. Each LED channel needs a flash node and
torch node for itself, and an individual switch node to serve as an overall switch.

Required Properties:
- label			: Type of led that will be used, either "flash", "torch", or "switch.
- qcom,led-name		: Name of the LED.
- qcom,default-led-trigger	: Trigger for the camera flash and torch. Accepted values are
			  "flash0_trigger", "flash1_trigger", "flash2_trigger, "torch0_trigger",
			  "torch1_trigger", "torch2_trigger", and "switch_trigger".
- qcom,id		: ID for each physical LED equipped. In order to handle situation when
			  only 1 or 2 LEDs are installed, flash and torch nodes on LED channel 0
			  should be specified with ID 0; nodes on channel 1 be ID 1, etc. This is
			  not required for switch node.
- qcom,max-current	: Maximum current allowed on this LED. Valid values should be
			  integer from 0 to 1500 inclusive. Flash 2 should have maximum current of
			  750 per hardware requirement. Unit is mA. For torch, the maximum current
			  is clamped at 500 mA. This is not required for the switch node.
- qcom,duration-ms	: Required property for flash nodes but not needed for torch. Integer
			  type specifying flash duration. Values are from 10ms to 1280ms with
			  10ms resolution. This is not required for switch node.

Optional properties:
- qcom,current-ma	: operational current intensity for LED in mA. Accepted values are a
			  positive integer in the range of 0 to qcom,max-current inclusive.
- qcom,ires-ua		: Integer type to specify current resolution. Accepted values should be
			  12500, 10000, 7500, and 5000. Unit is uA.
- qcom,hdrm-voltage-mv	: Integer type specifying headroom voltage. Values are from 125mV to 500mV
			  with 25mV resolution. Default setting is 325mV
- qcom,hdrm-vol-hi-lo-win-mv	: Integer type to specify headroom voltage swing range. Values are
				  from 0mV to 375mV with 25mV resolution. Default setting is 100mV.
- pinctrl-names		: Name of the pinctrl configuration that will be used when external GPIOs
			  are used for enabling/disabling, HW strobing of flash LEDs. For more
			  information on using pinctrl, please refer
			  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pinctrl/msm-pinctrl.txt
                          Following are the pinctrl configs that can be specified:
                          "led_enable" : pinctrl config to enable led. This should specify the active
                          configuration defined for each pin or pin group.
                          "led_disable" : pinctrl config to disable led. This should specify the sleep
                          configuration defined for each pin or pin group.
                          "strobe_enable" : pinctrl config to enable hw-strobe. This should specify the
                          active configuration defined for each pin or pin group.
                          "strobe_disable" : pinctrl config to disable hw-strobe. This should specify the
                          sleep configuration defined for each pin or pin group.
- qcom,hw-strobe-gpio	: phandle to specify GPIO for hardware strobing. This is used when there is no
			  pinctrl support or PMIC GPIOs are used.
- qcom,hw-strobe-sel	: Boolean property to enable hardware strobe. If not defined, software strobe
			  will be used.
- qcom,hw-strobe-edge-trigger	: Boolean property to select trigger type. If defined, hw-strobe is set to
				  be edge triggered. Otherwise, it is level triggered.
- qcom,hw-strobe-active-low	: Boolean property to select strobe signal polarity. If defined, hw-strobe
				  signal polarity is set to active-low, else it is active-high.
